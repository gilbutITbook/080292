# Java Reflection Classes, interfaces, constructors, methods and fields
This chapter includes 17 problems that involve the Java Reflection API. From classical topics, such as inspecting and instantiating Java artifacts (e.g., modules, packages, classes, interfaces, super-classes, constructors, methods, annotations, arrays, etc), to synthetic and bridge constructs or nest-based access control (JDK 11), this chapter provides solid coverage of the Java Reflection API.
