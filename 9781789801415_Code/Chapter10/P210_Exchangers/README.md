# Exchangers
Write a program that simulates via **Exchanger** an assembly line for checking and packing up bulbs using two workers. A worker (the checker) is checking bulbs and add them in a basket. When the basket is full, the worker gives it to the other worker (the packer) from which he receives an empty basket. The process repeats until the assembly line stops.
