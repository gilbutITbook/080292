# Work-stealing thread pool
Write a program that relies on a work-stealing thread pool. More precisely, write a program that simulates an assembly line for checking and packing up bulbs as follows: checking takes place
during the day, while packing takes place at night. The checking process result in a queue of 15 millions bulbs every day.
