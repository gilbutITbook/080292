# Fork/join framework
Write a program that relies on fork/join framework to sum the elements of a list. Write a program that relies on fork/join framework to compute the Fibonacci number at the given position (e.g. F12 = 144). In addition, write a program that exemplifies the usage of **CountedCompleter**.
